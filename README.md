# Rock Paper Scissors (Lizard Spock)

Rock Paper Scissors (Lizard Spock) is part of The Odin Project's curriculum to learn web development and JavaScript. 

It consists of a simple user interface that allows you, the player, to embark on a wild rock paper scissors (lizard spock) game against none other than Sheldon Cooper (actually, you'll just be playing against the computer, but use your imagination and pretend it's Sheldon).
